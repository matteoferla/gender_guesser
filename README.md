# gender_guesser
A small wee script that helps assign possible gender to a list of names.      
Say you are procrastinacoding and analysis author lists in the NCBI and you want to roughly guess the genders/sex of people.
It comes with a json file or a module with a class (see python file).     
It uses US census 1990 data because the US is big and multiethinic.      
Obviously, it will not always be right, hence the probability indicators for it, but most of the time the confidence is high.

Lastly, I obvious am not assertaining that names should be gendered, I am just using the fact that, historical and presently, most names are indeed gender specific.
