# gender_guesser
A small wee script that helps assign gender to a list of names. Say you are procrastinacoding and analysis author lists in the NCBI and you want to roughly guess the genders/sex of people.
It comes with a json file or a module with a class (see python file).
It uses US census 1990 data because the US is big and multiethinic.
